# TASK CHAINS
runUserTask = userTaskChain

task chains PAUSE user tasks


Potential Long term TODOS:
- Simplify chains
  - Potentially remove SingleTaskChain (make EVERY task chain able to return a task if it has a high enough priority)
  - Make adding task chains simpler, but try to discourage people to make task chains when a task would suffice
  - Make it clear that priority is parallel and task execution is NOT parallel (only one at a time)
